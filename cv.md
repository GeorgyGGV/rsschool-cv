**"Sum of positive" from CODEWARS:** You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.
```javascript
function positiveSum(arr) {

   var sum=0  
   for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++){  
    if (arr[i]>0){    
      sum+=arr[i]     
     console.log(sum)       
    }  
  }
